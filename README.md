here are some basic concepts in react such as components, props, and state. <br><br>
I hope you guys have basic knowledge to creating a new react app, if not navigate to https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html <br> 
<b><u>What is a component in react</u></b>
Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components.
Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen. we'll see the use of components api
<br>
<b><u>What is props in react </u></b>
In ReactJS, the props are a type of object where the value of attributes of a tag is stored. The word “props” implies “properties”, and its working functionality is quite similar to HTML attributes. Basically, these props components are read-only components. we will see how props are passed to components in react<br>
<b><u>What is states in react </u></b>
The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders. we will see the use react states in next tutorial <br>

<br><b>Here are some examples of use of react props states and components</b>
